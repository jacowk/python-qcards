System Requirements
====================

This application is used to manage and review qcards at scheduled intervals.

Categories represents larger topics, for example Java or Python. One category can have multiple stacks associated with it.

Stacks represents a stack of QCards to be reviewed together, and that related to the Category. A stack can be a subcategory of the broader category, for example a stack of qcards related to java.lang methods. One stack can have multiple cards associated with it. A stack has a last review date and a next review date. All stacks that are active and that has a next review date of today, should be retrieved for review.

Review phases represents the stages when stacks can be scheduled to be reviewed. A stack can be scheduled for review as follows:
- Daily review
- Review every 2nd day, odd days (1, 3, 5, etc) or even days (2, 4, 6, etc)
- Weekly review - A stack can be scheduled for review on a specified day of the week, Mon, Tue, Wed, etc
- Weekly also has a related week count. 1 = Review once a week. 2 = Review once every 2nd week. 3 = Review once every 3rd week. It's not necessary to define 4, because that is once a month.
- Monthly review - A stack can be scheduled for review on a specified day of the month, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
- Monthly also has a related month count. 1 = Review once a month. 2 = Review once every 2nd month. Etc

Cards represents cards that can be reviewed. A card has a title, a front and back content. The idea is to first display the front, and then on user action, a click or enter, display the back content. Card has a view count and group count.
View count means that every time the user views it, the view count is incremented.
Group count has 3 possible values. 1 = Front, 2 = Middle, 3 = Back. When retrieving the cards, order them by first by group count, and then by card id, the primary key of t_card. In this way, you can control which cards you want to review first.
A card also has an active flag. Only review cards that are active. Using this flag, you can control which cards you want to view or not view.

UI Python Scripts
=================
qcards_text_app.py - The main qcards application, using a text based GUI.
qcards_app.py - The main qcards application, using Tkinter.
category_gui.py - Containing user interface code for managing categories using Tkinter.
qcards_gui_util.py - A util file containing utilities for the gui

Backend Python Scripts
======================
qcards_initial_db_test.py - An initial script to make a connection to the database
qcards_db.py - A script for performing database functions in a generic way.
qcards_date_util.py - A script with functions to do all kinds of static date calculations
qcards_util.py - A script with some utility static functions
manage_categories.py - A script containing classes to manage categories, such as inserting categories to a database, updating categories, and retrieving categories.
manage_stacks.py - CRUD operations on stacks
manage_cards.py - CRUD operations on the qcards
manage_review_stage.py - CRUD operations on the review stages for the qcards. Reviewing a card daily, 2nd daily, weekly or monthly?

Review Stage Calculation Functions
==================================
Calculate the next odd date: qcards_date_util.py, DateUtil.calculate_next_odd_date()
Calculate the next even date: qcards_date_util.py, DateUtil.calculate_next_even_date()
Calculate the next view date for every second day: manage_review_stage.py, CalculateEverySecondDayNextViewDate's run method. This method calls the first 2 methods.

For updating the next view date, call UpdateNextViewDate's run method (manage_stacks.py)

Updating review stage configurations
====================================
manage_review_stage.py is the main file where these are done
Add an initial daily review stage - AddReviewStage
Set the review stage to 2nd daily - UpdateEverySecondDayReviewStage
Set the review stage to weekly - UpdateWeeklyReviewStage
Set the review stage to monthly - UpdateMonthlyReviewStage

Typical Execution Order of Functions
====================================
1. Run the UI application with qcards_app.py, or the text based application with qcards_text_app.py
2. Add a category with the AddCategory class's run() function (manage_categories.py)
3. Add a stack for the category with the AddStack class's run() funtion (manage_stacks.py)
4. Add a qcard for in the stack with the AddCard class's run() function (manage_cards.py)
5. Add the initial review stage for the card with AddReviewStage class's run() function (manage_review_stage.py) The initial review stage is to view the cards daily.
6. To simply review all active cards by stack id, use the RetrieveAllActiveCardsByStackId class's run() function (manage_cards.py). This will not consider the review stage.
7. Once a card is viewed and you go to the next card, update the view statistics using the UpdateViewStatistics class's run() function (manage_cards.py). Increment the view count by 1 and update the last view date.
8. To change the review stage to every 2nd day, call UpdateEverySecondDayReviewStage (manage_review_stage.py)
9. To calculate the next view date for a 2nd daily view stage, call CalculateEverySecondDayNextViewDate (manage_review_stage.py)
10. Once the next view date is calculated, update the next view date on stack level with UpdateNextViewDate (manage_stacks.py)
11. To change the review stage to weekly, call UpdateWeeklyReviewStage (manage_review_stage.py)
12. To calculate the next view date for a weekly view stage, call CalculateWeeklyNextViewDate (manage_review_stage.py)
13. Update the next view date on stack level with UpdateNextViewDate (manage_stacks.py)
14. To change the review stage to monthly, call UpdateMonthlyReviewStage (manage_review_stage.py)
15. To calculate the next view date for a montly view stage, call CalculateMonthlyNextViewDate (manage_review_stage.py)
16. Update the next view date on stack level with UpdateNextViewDate (manage_stacks.py)
17. To retrieve stacks to review, call RetrieveStacksForReview (manage_stacks.py)

General classes and functions
=============================
To retrieve a single stack, call RetrieveStackById (manage_stacks.py)
To retrieve all stacks, call RetrieveAllStacks (manage_stacks.py)
To retrieve active stacks by category id, call RetrieveActiveStacksByCategoryId (manage_stacks.py)
To update a stack, call UpdateStack (manage_stacks.py)

To retrieve a single card, call RetrieveCardById (manage_cards.py)
To retrieve all cards, call RetrieveAllCards (manage_cards.py)
To retrieve active cards by stack id, call RetrieveAllActiveCardsByStackId (manage_cards.py)
    - This class also can order by group cd or only by card id, depending on a flag provided when calling run()
To update a card, call UpdateCard (manage_cards.py)
To update a card group (Front, Middle or Back), call UpdateCardGroup (manage_cards.py)

To setup a stack of cards using unit testing
============================================
Until the UI development is done, stacks and cards can be set up with unit testing
1. Add a category with AddCategoryTest (manage_categories_test.py)
2. Get the category id with this query, which is required to add a stack: select * from t_category;
3. Add a stack with AddStackTest (manage_stacks_test.py)
4. Getting the stack id, which is required for adding cards: select * from t_stack;
5. Prep the cards in a pipe delimited csv file with the following headings: summary|front_content|back_content
6. Import the cards with AddMultipleCardsTest (manage_cards_test.py)
